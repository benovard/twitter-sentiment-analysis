The main data pulling from Twitter is done in main.py.

predict_multiple.py and predict_series.py do the prediction using a neural network.

The files with the id's of the tweets I pulled were too big to be uploaded to Github, but can be downloaded
from this site: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/5QCCUU

Any script that references 'climate_id.txt' through 'climate_id4.txt' is referencing these files.
